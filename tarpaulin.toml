# Tarpaulin coverage configuration
#
# Run with: cargo tarpaulin
# Or for full 95%+ coverage excluding CUDA:
#   cargo tarpaulin --exclude-files "crates/tropical-gemm-cuda/*"

[default]
# Use LLVM engine for better inline function coverage (95%+ vs 82%)
engine = "Llvm"

# Run for whole workspace
workspace = true

# Exclude GPU crates from testing (requires specific hardware)
exclude = ["tropical-gemm-cuda", "tropical-gemm-metal"]

# Note: exclude_files doesn't work reliably with LLVM engine in config file.
# Use CLI flag --exclude-files "crates/tropical-gemm-cuda/*" for accurate totals.
